# Finance-Department-Explanatory-Visualization-Data-Driven-Funding-Proposal
In this project, I acted as the Finance Department Chair to develop a persuasive, data-driven proposal for the Dean, advocating for the addition of a new faculty member. Using Excel to analyze real university data, I uncovered key trends in enrollment, student-to-faculty ratios, and departmental growth. I then applied storytelling with data principles and crafted explanatory visualizations that translated these insights into a clear narrative. The final PowerPoint presentation was designed for a leadership audience, balancing analytical depth with visual clarity to support strategic decision-making.
